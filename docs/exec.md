# Voice Agent Platform - Execution Plan

## Project Summary & Current Status (September 2025)

**Voice Agent Deployment Platform** is an AI-powered system that enables businesses to create intelligent conversational voice agents through a streamlined onboarding process with LiveKit cloud infrastructure.

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED PHASES (1-3 @ 95%)**
- **Foundation Setup**: Complete FastAPI backend + Vite frontend infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **Data Pipeline**: ChromaDB vector storage, OpenAI integration, async processing ‚úÖ  
- **LiveKit Voice System**: Real cloud deployment with OpenAI Realtime API integration ‚úÖ (95%)

### üéØ **CURRENT STATUS: Critical 401 Authentication Bug**
The platform has complete voice infrastructure deployed on LiveKit Cloud with functional voice agents and testing interface. All components working except final voice connection authentication.

### Core Flow (95% Working)
1. ‚úÖ **Business Input**: Company provides website URL + documents
2. ‚úÖ **AI Onboarding**: Dynamic interview generates contextual questions
3. ‚úÖ **Data Processing**: Parallel web scraping (Tavily) + PDF parsing into ChromaDB
4. ‚úÖ **Agent Creation**: Knowledge-based agent configuration with business-specific data
5. ‚úÖ **Voice Deployment**: LiveKit cloud infrastructure with agent worker registration
6. ÔøΩ **Voice Connection**: 401 Unauthorized preventing voice conversations
7. ‚è≥ **Production Polish**: Final debugging and optimization

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

### üö® Voice Connection 401 Unauthorized Error

#### Problem Summary:
- **Frontend**: Successfully creates voice sessions and receives valid tokens
- **Backend**: Generates proper JWT tokens with correct LiveKit credentials  
- **Agent Worker**: Successfully registered on LiveKit Cloud (ID: AW_JfznrqHbi3em)
- **LiveKit Connection**: Fails with 401 Unauthorized across all regions

#### Error Pattern:
```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://demo-bbxmozir.livekit.cloud/rtc?access_token=...' failed
GET https://demo-bbxmozir.livekit.cloud/rtc/validate?access_token=... 401 (Unauthorized)
Initial connection failed... Retrying with another region
```

#### Verified Working Components:
‚úÖ **Backend Session Creation**: `/api/voice/2/session` returns valid session data  
‚úÖ **JWT Token Generation**: Tokens created with proper permissions and expiration  
‚úÖ **Agent Worker Registration**: Worker registered and running on LiveKit Cloud  
‚úÖ **Frontend Integration**: ES module loading and session management functional  
‚úÖ **Room Creation**: Unique room names generated correctly (agent-2-a956a9b2)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
‚ùå **Agent Worker Not Receiving Room Events**: No logs showing room join attempts  
‚ùå **Token Validation Mismatch**: Possible API key/secret inconsistency  
‚ùå **Room Dispatch Issue**: Agent worker not responding to room creation
---

## IMMEDIATE DEBUGGING STRATEGY

### üéØ **STEP 1: Agent Worker Room Reception Analysis** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Objective**: Determine if agent worker is receiving room join events

**Debug Actions**:
1. **Add Extensive Logging** to `backend/voice_agents/agent.py`:
```python
async def entrypoint(ctx: agents.JobContext):
    logger.info(f"üî• ENTRYPOINT CALLED - Room: {ctx.room.name}")
    logger.info(f"üî• Room participants: {len(ctx.room.participants)}")
    logger.info(f"üî• Agent initialization starting...")
```

2. **Monitor Agent Worker Terminal** during connection attempts
3. **Test Room Creation** and verify worker logs show activity

### üéØ **STEP 2: Token Validation Testing** (HIGH PRIORITY)  
**Objective**: Verify JWT token generation matches LiveKit expectations

**Debug Actions**:
1. **Token Payload Inspection** in `backend/routes/voice_control.py`:
```python
def generate_access_token(room_name, participant_name):
    payload = {
        "iss": LIVEKIT_API_KEY,
        "sub": participant_name,
        "aud": "livekit",
        "exp": now + 3600,
        "nbf": now - 10,
        "room": room_name,
        "permissions": permissions
    }
    logger.info(f"üîë Token payload: {payload}")
    token = jwt.encode(payload, LIVEKIT_API_SECRET, algorithm="HS256")
    logger.info(f"üîë Generated token: {token[:50]}...")
    return token
```

2. **Environment Variable Audit**:
```bash
# Verify these match LiveKit Cloud setup exactly
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=APIxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://demo-bbxmozir.livekit.cloud
```

### üéØ **STEP 3: Manual Connection Testing** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Objective**: Test LiveKit connection outside of our application

**Debug Actions**:
1. **LiveKit CLI Testing** (if available)
2. **Token Validation via LiveKit API** directly
3. **Manual WebSocket Connection** with generated tokens
