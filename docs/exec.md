# Voice Agent Platform - Execution Plan

## Project Summary

**Voice Agent Deployment Platform** is an AI-powered system that enables businesses to create intelligent conversational voice agents through a streamlined onboarding process. The platform automatically scrapes business data, conducts AI-driven interviews, and deploys embeddable voice widgets that can handle customer inquiries, capture leads, and book appointments.

### Core Flow
1. **Business Input**: Company provides website URL + documents
2. **AI Onboarding**: Dynamic interview generates 8-12 contextual questions
3. **Data Processing**: Parallel web scraping (Tavily) + PDF parsing into vector database
4. **Agent Creation**: RAG-powered voice agent with business-specific knowledge
5. **Deployment**: Embeddable widget with LiveKit voice infrastructure

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + ChromaDB + OpenAI GPT-4o mini + LiveKit
- **Frontend**: Simple npm application with minimal dashboard
- **External**: Tavily API (web scraping), Calendar MCP (booking)

## Development Guidelines

### Daily Development Process
1. **Morning Setup**
   - Activate conda environment: `.venv/Scripts/activate`
   - Pull latest changes from repository
   - Review current phase tasks and priorities

2. **Development Cycle**
   - Implement backend functionality first
   - Test backend endpoints thoroughly
   - Implement corresponding frontend features
   - Test integration between frontend and backend
   - Commit working features incrementally

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for individual functions
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows
   - Manual testing for UI/UX validation

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Standards**: 4 spaces for Python, 2 spaces for JavaScript
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for all functions, API endpoint documentation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user-friendly messages
- **Version Control**: Meaningful commit messages, feature branches for major changes

### Risk Mitigation
- **External API Dependencies**: Implement fallback mechanisms and proper error handling
- **Data Processing**: Validate all inputs and handle edge cases
- **Performance**: Monitor memory usage and implement caching where appropriate
- **User Experience**: Test with various input types and edge cases

This execution plan provides a structured approach to building the Voice Agent Platform with clear testing milestones at each phase to ensure quality and functionality before proceeding to the next development stage.
