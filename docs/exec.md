## Phase 5: LiveKit Voice Integration (Current Priority)

### Overview
Transform existing text-based agents into fully functional voice agents using LiveKit's real-time infrastructure.

### Week 1: LiveKit Backend Foundation

#### Day 1-2: Environment Setup
```bash
# Install LiveKit dependencies
pip install livekit-agents livekit-api

# Update requirements.txt
echo "livekit-agents==0.8.0" >> requirements.txt
echo "livekit-api==0.5.0" >> requirements.txt
```

**Tasks:**
1. **LiveKit Account Setup**
   - Create LiveKit Cloud account
   - Get API keys and add to .env file
   - Test basic connectivity

2. **Service Architecture**
   ```
   backend/services/
   ├── livekit_service.py      # Room management, tokens
   ├── voice_agent.py          # Core voice processing logic  
   ├── voice_tools.py          # Agent tools (RAG, lead capture)
   └── webhook_handler.py      # LiveKit event processing
   ```

#### Day 3-4: Core Voice Agent Implementation
**File: `backend/services/voice_agent.py`**
```python
class VoiceAgent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id: int, chromadb_collection: str):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.knowledge_base = chromadb_collection
        self.conversation_state = {}
    
    async def process_speech(self, audio_input):
        # STT → Intent Recognition → RAG → Response → TTS
        pass
    
    async def handle_conversation_turn(self, transcript: str):
        # Main conversation processing logic
        pass
```

**Integration Points:**
- Connect to existing ChromaDB collections for RAG
- Use current OpenAI service for response generation
- Leverage existing agent configurations from database

#### Day 5: API Endpoints
**New routes in `backend/routes/voice.py`:**
```python
@router.post("/voice/token/{agent_id}")
async def generate_voice_token(agent_id: int):
    # Generate LiveKit access token for specific agent
    pass

@router.post("/voice/deploy/{agent_id}")  
async def deploy_voice_agent(agent_id: int):
    # Deploy agent to LiveKit room
    pass

@router.get("/voice/status/{agent_id}")
async def get_voice_status(agent_id: int):
    # Check deployment and session status
    pass

@router.post("/voice/webhook")

    async def provide_business_info(self, info_type: str):
        # Business hours, contact info from knowledge base
        pass
```

#### Day 3-4: Widget Deployment
**Embeddable Widget Implementation:**

   ```javascript
   // Static widget code that clients can embed
   class VoiceAgentWidget {
       constructor(config) {
           this.agentId = config.agentId;
           this.theme = config.theme;
           this.position = config.position;
       }
       
       async initialize() {
           // Connect to LiveKit room for specific agent
