- Real-time vs batch processing for voice responses
- Monitoring and analytics implementation

### Development Velocity
- **Phases 1-3**: Completed rapidly with solid foundation
- **Phase 4**: Should be quick (mostly CRUD + UI)
- **Phase 5**: More complex (new LiveKit integration)

**Current state: Ready for Phase 5 development - LiveKit Voice Integration**

### Development Velocity Assessment
- **Phases 1-4**: Completed successfully with robust foundation
- **Phase 5**: Main technical challenge - LiveKit SDK integration
- **Phase 6+**: Polish and advanced features on solid base

### Next Chat Session Preparation
The platform is now fully prepared for voice integration development:
