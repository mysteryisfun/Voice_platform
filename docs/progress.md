## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Phase 5 - LiveKit Voice Integration (CRITICAL PATH)

#### 1. LiveKit Backend Integration
**Goal**: Transform text-based agents into fully functional voice agents

**Backend Tasks**:
- Install and configure LiveKit Python SDK (`livekit-agents`, `livekit-api`)
- Create LiveKit room management service
- Implement voice agent core logic:
  - Speech-to-Text (STT) processing using LiveKit's built-in capabilities
  - RAG-powered response generation using existing ChromaDB knowledge
  - Text-to-Speech (TTS) output with natural voice
  - Real-time conversation state management
- Add LiveKit endpoints:
  - `POST /api/voice/token` - Generate LiveKit access tokens for specific agents
  - `POST /api/voice/deploy/{agent_id}` - Deploy agent to LiveKit room
  - `GET /api/voice/status/{agent_id}` - Check voice agent deployment status
  - `POST /api/voice/webhook` - Handle LiveKit events and callbacks

**Integration Points**:
- Connect existing agent configurations to LiveKit deployment
- Use existing ChromaDB collections for RAG responses
- Integrate with current agent management system

#### 2. Frontend Voice Interface
**Goal**: Provide voice testing and widget generation capabilities

**Frontend Tasks**:
- Add voice testing interface to agent dashboard
- Implement LiveKit client SDK for browser-based voice sessions
- Create voice session controls (start/stop conversation, mute, etc.)
- Add widget code generation and preview
- Update agent cards to show voice deployment status

**UI Components**:
- Voice test button in agent dashboard (replace current placeholder)
- Voice session interface with real-time conversation display
- Widget customization panel (appearance, positioning, branding)
- Embeddable widget code generation with copy-to-clipboard

#### 3. Agent Tools Implementation
**Goal**: Make voice agents functionally useful for business purposes

**Core Tools**:
- **RAG Knowledge Retrieval**: Answer questions using business-specific knowledge
- **Lead Capture**: Collect visitor information during conversations
- **Basic Information**: Provide business hours, contact info, services
- **Appointment Booking**: (Phase 6) Schedule meetings via calendar integration

### Priority 2: Production Polish
**Goal**: Make the platform production-ready for real business use

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Voice session failure recovery
   - Network disconnection handling
   - Graceful degradation when services unavailable

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Voice latency minimization
   - Efficient RAG response generation
   - Real-time conversation state management

3. **Widget Deployment**

## Technical Debt & Notes

### Current Architecture Status
- ✅ **Scalable**: Agent-specific knowledge isolation working
- ✅ **Async**: Background processing doesn't block user flow
- ✅ **Robust**: Error handling and status tracking implemented
- ⚠️ **Misleading**: Agent "deployed" status implies voice capability

### Next Architecture Decisions
- LiveKit vs alternatives for voice integration
- Widget deployment strategy (iframe vs SDK)
- Real-time vs batch processing for voice responses
- Monitoring and analytics implementation

### Development Velocity
- **Phases 1-3**: Completed rapidly with solid foundation
- **Phase 4**: Should be quick (mostly CRUD + UI)
- **Phase 5**: More complex (new LiveKit integration)

**Current state: Ready for Phase 5 development - LiveKit Voice Integration**

### Development Velocity Assessment
- **Phases 1-4**: Completed successfully with robust foundation
- **Phase 5**: Main technical challenge - LiveKit SDK integration
- **Phase 6+**: Polish and advanced features on solid base

### Next Chat Session Preparation
The platform is now fully prepared for voice integration development:
1. **Foundation Complete**: All supporting systems operational
2. **Documentation Updated**: Clear roadmap for LiveKit implementation
3. **Agent Management**: Professional interface for testing and deployment
4. **Knowledge Base**: RAG system ready for voice interaction
5. **API Structure**: Backend prepared for voice endpoint integration

**Recommended next session focus**: LiveKit Python SDK setup and basic voice agent implementation
