class LiveKitService:
    - Room creation and management
    - Access token generation for specific agents
    - Agent deployment to rooms
    - Webhook handling for session events
```

#### 2. Voice Agent Core Logic
```python
# New service: backend/services/voice_agent.py
class VoiceAgent:
    - STT processing using LiveKit's speech-to-text
    - RAG integration with existing ChromaDB collections
    - Response generation using OpenAI GPT-4o mini
    - TTS output with natural voice synthesis
    - Conversation state management
    - Agent tool execution (lead capture, knowledge retrieval)
```

#### 3. New API Endpoints
```
POST /api/voice/token/{agent_id}
- Generate LiveKit access token for specific agent

- Log conversation events for analytics
```

### Frontend Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Voice Testing Interface

- Execute appropriate tool with conversation context
- Return structured response through TTS
- Update relevant databases (leads, analytics)

### Technical Implementation Details

#### LiveKit Python SDK Integration
```python
# Agent deployment process
async def deploy_voice_agent(agent_id: int):
    1. Get agent configuration from database
    2. Connect to agent's ChromaDB collection
    3. Create LiveKit room with agent-specific settings
    4. Start voice processing pipeline
    5. Register agent tools and capabilities
    6. Update deployment status
```

#### Voice Session Management
```python
# Real-time voice processing
async def handle_voice_session(room, participant):
    1. STT: Convert speech to text
    2. Intent Recognition: Understand user request
    3. RAG Query: Search agent's knowledge base
    4. Response Generation: Create contextual answer
    5. TTS: Convert response to speech
    6. Tool Execution: Handle lead capture, appointments
```

### Widget Deployment Strategy

#### Embeddable Widget Components
- **JavaScript Library**: Self-contained widget with LiveKit client
